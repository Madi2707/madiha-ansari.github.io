        <section id="dashboard1">
            <img src="images/aims_dash1.jpg" alt="Accident Severity Dashboard">
            <p>This Dashboard visualizes locations with the frequency and severity of accidents on different routes. I used DBSCAN Clustering Algorithm to identify route clusters.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Dashboard Section 2 -->
        <section id="dashboard2">
            <img src="images/aims_dash2.jpg" alt="Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard">
            <p>The daily monitoring Dashboard provides details of daily accidents. It displays accident locations, routes, and severity, enabling quick responses from emergency services or operational actions.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Dashboard Section 3 -->
        <section id="dashboard3">
             <img src="images/aims_dash3.jpg" alt="Predictive Analysis Dashboard">
            <p>The above provides a comprehensive overview into driver behavior, driver experience, amount and type of damage. It also tracks individual driver violations, enabling the operations team to identify trends and deliver customized training for drivers. The insights help in fostering a safer driving environment and optimizing overall fleet performance.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Dashboard Section 4 -->
        <section id="dashboard4">
            <img src="images/aims_dash4.jpg" alt="Predictive Analysis Dashboard">
            <p>This dashboard offers a detailed analysis of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) performance. The data-driven insights help optimize vehicle safety features and enhance driver support, promoting safer and more efficient driving.</p>
            <p>We are monitoring the performance of 36 ADAS fitted route buses. Four of them have camera mirrors. We get data from the telematics to compare and create algorithm based analytics</p>

            <h2>Predictive Analysis Application</h2>
            <img src="images/pred_aims_appl.jpg" alt="Predictive Analysis Dashboard">
            <p>The application above utilizes predictive analytics to forecast accident fault. It takes nine categorical features and predicts the outcome of who was at fault. The features are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Light Condition</li>
                <li>Weather Condition</li>
                <li>Traffic Condition</li>
                <li>Road Type</li>
                <li>Accident Cause</li>
                <li>Road</li>
                <li>Collision Type</li>
                <li>Damage Type</li>
                <li>Location of Damage</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It has been further enhanced to predict liability cost based on same features.</p>

        <!-- Conclusion Section -->
        <section id="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The Intelligent Accidents Monitoring and Management System represents a significant advancement in road safety technology, leveraging the power of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). By integrating advanced data visualization with predictive modeling, the system not only identifies patterns and trends in real-time accident data but also forecasts potential incidents. This AI-driven approach provides a comprehensive tool for proactively managing and mitigating the impact of road accidents, enhancing decision-making, and ultimately contributing to safer public transportion.</p>
