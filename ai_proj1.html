            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>The project aims to develop a solution that uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to automate the extraction of sensitive data from financial invoices and remittances. This solution will focus on accurately identifying key financial details such as payment amounts, invoice numbers, dates, client names, and sensitive account details.</p>
            <p>In this project, I developed an automated solution using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract and classify sensitive financial data from invoices and remittances. The focus was on enhancing accuracy through image preprocessing techniques, model tuning, and secure handling of extracted data.</p>
